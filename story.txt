Once upon a time, a man went to the store. It had been a long and busy week, and when he sat in his favorite couch at the end of the day, he realized he was very lonely. The man went to the store to buy another box of cereal for himself, ashamed as he was to admit, he had already gone through 3. While he made his way through the seafood aisle, he noticed a strange creature floating around in a tank. Fascinating, he thought to himself, they usually don't stock octopi on Fridays. The bright undulating colors of the octopus drew the man nearer to the tank in a sort of hypnotic trance. There is in front of me, he muttered to himself, another lonely creature that wants a friend. Well, maybe not a friend, but at least someone to be with. I suppose you could watch the house while I'm gone during the day, he suggested to the octopus, now staring back at his new friend.
